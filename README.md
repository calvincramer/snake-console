# Snake using ANSI Escape Sequences

[ANSI](http://www.termsys.demon.co.uk/vtansi.htm) (American National Standards Institute) escape sequences allow control of the terminal just by printing specific strings. Unfortunately not all terminals support all features, so things like colors may appear differently on different terminals. I made this for Linux based systems with Docker and a Windows 10 host OS (using command prompt and [Cmder](https://cmder.net/)).

Credit to [sd9](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/game-programming-non-blocking-key-input-740422/) for sections pertaining to changing the behavior of the standard input stream.

To compile the program, type `make` to run the Makefile. You'll need to do it on a Linux machine.
